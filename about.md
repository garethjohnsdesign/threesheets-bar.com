    Three Sheets is a neighbourhood café-bar in Dalston specialising in drinks. We
    take great care selecting our wine and beer, which we rotate regularly. The coffee
    is provided by Alchemy, which we serve alongside a range of snacks through the
    day, and into the evening. Our speciality is cocktails. With a weekly rotating
    seasonal menu, we aim to utilise modern kitchen techniques and ingredients to
    create drinks that are delicious and unique to the city. Noel recently moved to
    London from Manchester, where he was running Crazy Pedro’s, after stints at Trof
    and the Deaf Institute. Max recently left the position of Operations Manager at
    the Drink Factory, overseeing 69 Colebrooke Row, and opening Bar Termini. Previously
    he worked at Socio Rehab, and set up Almost Famous Burgers in Manchester, as well
    as a period at Rick’s Cocktail Bar in Edinburgh.
