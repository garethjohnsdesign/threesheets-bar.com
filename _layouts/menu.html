    	<h2>About</h2>
    	<p>Opened in September 2016, by brothers Noel and Max Venning, Three Sheets is a neighbourhood café-bar in Dalston specialising in drinks. We take great care selecting our wine and beer, which we rotate regularly. The coffee is provided by Alchemy, which we serve alongside a range of snacks through the day, and into the evening.
Our speciality is cocktails. With a weekly rotating seasonal menu, we aim to utilise modern kitchen techniques and ingredients to create drinks that are delicious and unique to the city.
Noel recently moved to London from Manchester, where he was running Crazy Pedro’s, after stints at Trof and the Deaf Institute.   
Max recently left the position of Operations Manager at the Drink Factory, overseeing 69 Colebrooke Row, and opening Bar Termini. Previously he worked at Socio Rehab, and set up Almost Famous Burgers in Manchester, as well as a period at Rick’s Cocktail Bar in Edinburgh.</p>
